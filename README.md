# JustSpeak
JustSpeak is a language learning App that teaches German and Chichewa. German was chosen because of the overwhelming demand I get as a part time German teacher in Malawi. I am passionate about teaching German but my capacity csnnot take in all the demand, however the knowledge of German I have has been transfered into JustSpeak so that even when my capacity is full, students can still learn with or without me. Chichewa was chosen because there are very little online resources that teach Chichewa, many expatriates in Malawi struggle to learn Chichewa as a result. I intend to use this app to give Expats to Malawi a resource for strong chichewa foundations.

This repository hosts the code that was used to build JustSpeak. It is built on Android SDK, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, firebase for backend and Room database for local storage. I am using MVVM and repository architecture.
